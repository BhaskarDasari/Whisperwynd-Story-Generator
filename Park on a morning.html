“Hey, Zoe! What’s the rush?” Suzanne called, giggling as she spotted a flurry of startled squirrels.

Zoe paused, eyes wide with mischief. “I swear I saw a rabbit!” She crouched low, the grass tickling her belly.

“Then let’s track it down! I’ll bring the popcorn for the show!” Suzanne laughed, imagining a rabbit chase unfolding as the sun warmed the park, its sweet scent mingling with hints of fresh blossoms.</td>

“Not for you, Zoe!” Suzanne chuckled, brushing the dirt off her hands. The cat paused, wide-eyed, feigning innocence before pouncing.

“Go on then, troublemaker!” she teased, glancing at the sun filtering through the crooked trees. The gentle rustling leaves whispered secrets, while distant laughter floated by, reminiscent of classic films echoing in charming nostalgia.</td>

“Zoe! Are you chasing rabbits again?” Suzanne chuckled, reaching out to scratch the cat's chin.
